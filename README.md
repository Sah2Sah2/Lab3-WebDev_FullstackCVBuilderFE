# CV Builder - Full-Stack Application üíª

## Overview  
This repository contains the third assignment for the **Web Development** course in the **.NET Cloud Developer program at IT-H√∂gskolan**. 
The project is a **full-stack application** consisting of a Blazor Web App Server front-end and a .NET API that performs **CRUD operations** on a **SQL database**. 
The application is hosted in **Azure** and communicates with the API to manage user data.

### Task Description  

The task was to create a full-stack application where:  
- The front end is built with **Blazor Server**  
- The API performs **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations  
- The database is connected through **Entity Framework Core**  
- The front end communicates with the API to display and manipulate data
- A third-party API is consumed in the project
- An Admin only view is avaible to perform POST and DELETE operations
- The project is deployed to **Azure**  

## Project Structure  
- **Backend**: .NET API for CRUD operations  
- **Frontend**: Blazor Server App  
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core  
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service  

## Technologies Used  
- .NET 8
- C#
- Blazor Web App Server  
- Entity Framework Core  
- Azure App Service  
- SQL Server

## Reflection  
This assignment allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building full-stack applications with .NET technologies. 
One of the biggest challenges was configuring the **Azure deployment** and ensuring that the front end could securely communicate with the API. 
Implementing **CRUD operations** using **Entity Framework Core** helped me strengthen both backend and frontend development skills. 
Additionally, working with Azure provided me with valuable insights into cloud deployments and how to configure application services in a cloud environment.

*This project was developed as part of my coursework to showcase my skills in .NET web development and cloud technologies.*
